# PWOP
This is our submission for the [Global Game Jam 2025 at UC Davis](https://globalgamejam.org/jam-sites/2025/uc-davis), a bubble popping game inspired by [QWOP](https://foddy.net/Athletics.html).

# Instructions
Score points by popping bubbles by catching them between fingers on both hands.

## Controls:
q, w, e, r, u, i, o, p, a, s, l, k, f, b, x, h.
Figuring out what they do is up to you.

You can also build a custom controller using our Arduino firmware using any device that supports USB keyboard emulation.
